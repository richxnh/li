{"body":"### li's framework,一个简单轻量的java web开发框架.\r\nli,这是一个简单轻量的javaweb开发框架,包含了Mvc Dao ActiveRecord Ioc Aop等功能的极其小巧的实现.\r\n\r\nAction代码示例\r\n```\r\n@Bean\r\npublic class PeopleAction extends AbstractAction {\r\n    @Inject\r\n    People peopleDao;\r\n\r\n    @At(\"people_list.do\")\r\n    public void list(Page page) {\r\n        setRequest(\"list\", peopleDao.list(page));\r\n        setRequest(\"page\", page);\r\n        view(\"people/list\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nActiveRecord代码示例\r\n```\r\n@Bean\r\n@Table(\"t_account\")\r\npublic class Account extends Record<Account> {\r\n    public Boolean login(Account account) {\r\n        String sql = \"WHERE username=#username AND password=#password\";\r\n        return null != find(sql, account);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n* GitHub项目链接 https://github.com/limingwei/li \r\n* 提问&讨论 https://github.com/limingwei/li/issues\r\n* 下载 http://code.google.com/p/liz/downloads/list\r\n* ChangeLog https://github.com/limingwei/li/wiki/changelog\r\n* Mail limingwei@mail.com\r\n* QQ 416133823\r\n* Q群 254860190","tagline":":-)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
